# Sanderling
Sanderling is a botting framework for [eve online](https://www.eveonline.com).
It helps you create and run eve online bots.

### Features
* **safe**: does not inject into or write to the eve online client. That is why using it with eve online is not detectable.
* **accurate & robust**: Sanderling uses memory reading to retrieve information about the game state. In contrast to screen scraping, this approach won't be thrown off by a noisy background or non-default UI settings.
* **comprehensive**: provides all tools needed to build mining, trading and mission bots.

### Requirements
* the application requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 which can be dowloaded from [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653).
