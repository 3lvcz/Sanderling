# Sanderling

**Sanderling is a framework that helps you create and run [eve online](https://www.eveonline.com) bots.**

### Features
* **safe**: does not inject into or write to the eve online client. That is why using it with eve online is not detectable.
* **accurate & robust**: Sanderling uses memory reading to retrieve information about the game state. In contrast to screen scraping, this approach won't be thrown off by a noisy background or non-default UI settings.
* **easy to use**: You will achieve quick results with the [integrated script engine](https://github.com/Arcitectus/Sanderling/wiki/Script-Engine) and API explorer.
* **comprehensive**: Sanderling provides all tools needed to build mining, trading and mission bots.
